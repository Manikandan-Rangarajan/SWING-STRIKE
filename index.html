                Runs and Points: In Swing Strike, there are a total of six runs, numbered from 1 to 6. Your goal is to score runs and accumulate points while preventing the computer from doing the same. Each successful run adds points to your overall score.
           </li>
           <li>Strikes: Whenever both you and the computer roll successive numbers, it's called a "strike." The key is to avoid accumulating three successive strikes in a row, as that will result in an "out" for your batting side. It's all about strategic decision-making to keep the inning alive and maintain your momentum.</li>
           <li>Number Matches: Swing Strike introduces an exciting element of number matches. If both you and the computer roll the same number during an at-bat, your batting score becomes a combination of your score and the computer's score. This adds a thrilling dimension of strategy as you aim to maximize your points and outsmart the computer.</li>
